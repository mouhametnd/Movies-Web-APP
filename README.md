# Frontend Mentor - Movies Web App
 
## Welcome üçÉ

This movie web app was a good project to put into practice my vanilla javascript, CSS and SCSS skills. The project is built with fetch, localStorage, gulp.js and new features like intersection observer, mutation observer and URLSearchParams.
